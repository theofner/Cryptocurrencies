# Cryptocurrencies

In this project we look at cryptocurrency data taken from [CryptoCompare](https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/all/coinlist) . We use a PCA algorithm and K-means clustering to identify distinct groups of coins with sufficient trading volume, and then plot the Coins Mined vs Coin Supply for each of these clusters. This can serve as a preliminary analysis to launch a further investigation of what attributes lead to the distinct properties of these different coins.
